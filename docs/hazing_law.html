<h1><em>Commonwealth of Massachusetts<br>General Laws 269:17, 18, 19</em></h1>

<h3><em>269:17 HAZING; ORGANIZING OR PARTICIPATING; HAZING DEFINED.</em></h3>

<P>Whoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime
of hazing, as defined herein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than
three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction for
not more than one, [sic] year, or both such fine and imprisonment.

<P>The term ``hazing'' as used in this section and in sections eighteen
and nineteen, shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student
organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or
recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other
person. Such conduct shall include whipping, beating, branding, forced
calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food,
liquor, beverage, drug or other substance, or any other brutal treatment
or forced physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical
health of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student
or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation
of sleep or rest or extended isolation.

<P>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary,
consent shall not be available as a defense to any prosecution under this
action.

<h3><em>269:18 FAILURE TO REPORT HAZING.</em></h3>

<P>Whoever knows that another person is the victim of hazing
as defined in section seventeen and is at the scene of such crime shall,
to the extent that such person can do so without danger or peril to himself
or others, report such crime to an appropriate law enforcement official
as soon as reasonably practicable. Whoever fails to report such crime shall
be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars.

<h3><em>269:19</em></h3>

<P>Each institution of secondary education and each public
and private institution of post secondary education shall issue to every
student group, student team or student organization which is part of such
institution or is recognized by the institution or permitted by the institution
to use its name or facilities or is known by the institution to exist as
an unaffiliated student group, student team, or student organization, a
copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen; provided, however,
that an institution's compliance with this section's requirements that
an institution issue copies of this section and sections seventeen and
eighteen to unaffiliated student groups, teams, or organizations shall
not constitute evidence of the institution's recognition or endorsement
of said unaffiliated student groups, teams or organizations.

<P>Each such group, team or organization shall distribute a copy of this
section and sections seventeen and eighteen to each of its members, plebes,
pledges or applicants for membership. It shall be the duty of each such
group, team or organization, acting through its designated officer, to
deliver annually, to the institution an attested acknowledgement stating
that such group, team or organization has received a copy of this section
and said sections seventeen and eighteen, that each of its member, plebes,
pledges, or applicants has received a copy of sections seventeen and eighteen,
and that such group, team or organization understands and agrees to comply
with the provisions of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen.

<P>Each institution of secondary education and each public or private institution
of post secondary education shall, at least annually, before or at the
start of enrollment, deliver to each person who enrolls as a full time
student in such institution a copy of this section and sections seventeen
and eighteen.

<P>Each institution of secondary education and each public or private institution
of post secondary education shall file, at least annually, a report with
the regents of higher education and in the case of secondary institutions,
the board of education, certifying that such institution has complied with
its responsibility to inform student groups, teams or organizations and
to notify each full time student enrolled by it of the provisions of this
section and sections seventeen and eighteen and also certifying that said
institution has adopted a disciplinary policy with regard to the organizers
and participants of hazing, and that such policy has been set forth with
appropriate emphasis in the student handbook or similar means of communication
the institution's policies to its students. The board of regents and, in
the case of secondary institutions, the board of education shall promulgate
regulations governing the content and frequency of such reports, and shall
forthwith report to the attorney general any such institution which fails
to make such report.
