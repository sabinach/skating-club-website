<P><H1> How to Buy and Care for Figure Skates </H1>
<H3>or, <EM>It's Not Your Weak Ankles, It's Your Cheap Skates!</EM></H3></P>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Copyright 1989 Sally R. DeFazio.</STRONG></CENTER></P>

<P>There are two prominent myths that stand between prospective
skaters and the enjoyment of skating.  First is the myth that certain
people will never be able to skate because of some inherent weakness
of their ankles.  Their feet flop from side to side, and at worst they
find themselves skating around on their insteps.  This dreadful
situation is enough to dampen all but the most fiery enthusiasm.  The
reality is that with properly fitted skates that give good support,
this apparent physical disability disappears.  Second is the belief
that sharp blades are for hot shots and that dull blades are safer for
the novice.  This rumor may have been started by the inventor of the
scissors you may remember from kindergarten, the ones that bend, but
don't cut, paper.  The resulting frustration level is the same, for
the reality is that unless blades are reasonably sharp, you can't
skate on them at all.</P>

<P>So how do we attain a "good" fit, with "proper" support and blade
sharpness?  First, stay away from department store skates - you'd
just be buying yourself another set of weak ankles.  Even the
better skates available at a general sporting goods store will
probably not be of the quality you need, and the salespeople there
will not usually be knowledgeable enough to help you choose your
skates.  Visit a store that specializes in figure skates, and be ready
to bite the bullet when it comes to cost.  Consider that good skates
help protect you from injury, and bad skates impede your progress.</P>

<H2> Buying Boots </H2>

<P>The first thing you'll notice at the skate shop is that boots and
blades are sold separately.  The boots you need must be stiff enough
to prevent most lateral motion (ankle flopping!) but must still allow
flexing of your ankle, enough to let you bend your knees deeply while
skating.  For comfort, the boots should also conform somewhat to your
feet.  The only material that really fills the bill is thick leather;
the plastic of department store skates doesn't even come close.  With
new boots the flexibility at the ankle will develop as you begin to
wear them (an important part of "breaking in" your skates - <A
HREF="#breaking"> more about that later</A>.)  Old boots can become so
heavily creased at the ankle that they no longer provide support
(they've "broken down").  The better the boots you buy, the longer
they'll last without breaking down, so look at good boots as an
investment.  In any event, your boots should be stiff enough <STRONG>
at least </STRONG> to support their own weight if you grab them by the
cuff and turn them upside down.</P>

<P>Additional support can be had with thicker leather and with
internal steel stiffeners, all at higher cost.  More expensive skates
also have other features that add to comfort, support, and injury
protection, e.g. leather linings and padding of the tongue and areas
around the foot.  Especially useful are built-in Achille's tendon pads
that cushion on either side of the tendon.</P>

<P>None of this expensive support is much good if your skates are too
big.  Filling up oversized skates with thick socks sill lose you
support since your foot can still slip inside the boot.  Your boots
should be large enough to let you wiggle your toes. but decidedly snug
through instep and heel <STRONG> while wearing thin socks </STRONG> (e.g., the
weight of tights).  Note that to keep your feet warm in figure skates,
you add insulation to the <EM> outside </EM> of your boots - boot
covers are available in a wide range of materials.</P>

<P>The best way for a beginner to achieve a proper fit is to seek out
a skate shop with a good reputation.  Be prepared to buy boots one to
one-and-a-half sizes smaller than your street shoes - that's what it
takes to get the snug fit.  ask the salesman for advice on brand of
boot if you suspect you have any orthopedic peculiarities.  The geometry
of different manufacturer's boots are slightly different, and making a
careful choice at this point may prevent many problems down the road.</P>

<H2> Buying Blades </H2>

<P>The blades of good skates are screwed (not riveted!) to the boot
soles so that different blades can be attached to meet the particular
needs and activities of the skater.  Also, this arrangement allows
adjustment of the mounting of the blade to provide for individual
physical requirements.</P>

<P>Blades are available with modifications for freestyle, figures, and
dance.  For beginners, a pair of the less expensive freestyle blades
is a good choice, even if your ultimate goal is ice dance (dance
blades are shorter from front to back and present difficulties for the
beginner).  If you plan to do any jumping, choose blades with a
reasonably competent set of toe picks (MK Single Stars or the
equivalent).  The picks of less expensive skates tend to give you a
less secure purchase on the ice during jumps with a toe pick
take-off.  On the other hand, the wicked-looking picks of the blades
designed for advanced skates (e.g. MK Phantoms) are definitely
"over-kill" for beginner-intermediate skaters.</P>

<P>Your skate seller will mount the blades for you using only half of
the available screw holes on the sole plate.  He's not shortchanging
you; the rest of the screw positions are then available for future
positioning adjustments or as alternatives if the original holes
become enlarged through wear.  Mounting blades correctly takes skill,
which is another reason why you should make the effort to find a
competent shop.</P>

<H2> <A NAME="breaking">Breaking Your Skates In </H2>

<P>The better the skates, the thicker the leather, the longer they
last without breaking down, the higher the cost, and the harder they
may be to break in.  It may seem at first that you've made a very
expensive mistake.  Persevere.  In most cases all your skates need is
for you to skate in them.  To hasten the process, some people find it
helpful to put on their blade guards and clomp around the house.
Others swear by a method which is indeed effective, but which has the
potential for harming your boots: put on a pair of wet socks before
donning your skates.  Many skate shop people shudder at the thought
since water is basically not good for leather.  And think how awful it
would be if you did this in wet weather and caused your boots to
mildew!</P>

<P>Usually your boots start breaking in your feet and ankles before
the reverse occurs.  Areas prone to blistering because of rubbing can
be bridged with thin pads.  But beware of jamming wads of pads into
your boots if the problem is one of pressure, as often happens over
your protruding ankle bones.  Obviously more stuff in your boots will
only make the pressure problem worse.  If after a reasonable break-in
period your skates and your anatomy are still squabbling over space,
go back to your skate shop.  Your skilled, all-knowing skate seller
may be able to stretch the leather in the problem area, usually
without charge.  Many of the problems of break-in can be avoided by
starting out with custom skates.  These are expensive and will still
require some breaking-in, but they may be the only answer for some
people with hard-to-fit feet.  One caution to the weekend skater - if
you buy yourself the super-supportive skates designed for
competitors, you may find that they <STRONG> never </STRONG> seem to
break in.</P>

<H2> Sharpening </H2>

<P><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="sally-blade.gif" WIDTH=175>
Sighting along the length of your "hollow ground" blade, you'll
notice that the concave shape has two "edges" (see figure at right).  These are the
basis of skating.  Without edges, your blades would slip laterally (a
very spooky feeling), and there'd be no "bite" when you used the blade
to stroke forward.  (Note that the toe picks of figure skates are
<STRONG> not </STRONG> used for propulsion in ordinary skating).
Sharpening involves regrinding to establish these edges when they've
worn away.  The radius of the concavity can be varied for different
purposes.  Beginners would do well to stick to a "general purpose"
figure blade sharpening.</P>

<P>A proper sharpening also establishes the "rocker" of the blade,
i.e. its very slight for-and-aft curvature.  Clearly figure blade
sharpening is a specialized skill.  <STRONG> Always </STRONG> take
your skates to someone who specializes in figure blades.  The
specialist will also have the proper respect for your toe picks.
Hockey skate sharpeners cannot be trusted to not grind off your
picks.  (And don't be tempted to have the picks ground off because
you're tripping over them - you'll need them as you progress, so
instead learn not to drag your toes!)  You'll probably need advice to
tell when your blades need resharpening for the first time.
Thereafter you'll begin to be able to recognize the insecure feeling
yourself.  Note that ultimately blades will wear out from many
sharpenings, so don't overdo it.</P>

<H2> Care of Your Skates </H2>

<P>Always use blade guards when walking around off the ice, or, second
best, stick to the rink's rubber matting.  <STRONG> Never </STRONG>
let your blades contact cement or metal.  When you use guards, be sure
there is no gritty dirt on the bottoms of your blades or inside the
guards.</P> 

<P>Water is the enemy.  When you take off your skates, wipe boots and
blades dry with an old towel.  Don't put your guards back on!  Instead
slip on a pair of terry blade covers.  These will wick away moisture
that condenses on your cold blades as you move into a warmer
environment.  Storing your blades in the rubber guards actually
encourages corrosion.</P>

<P>Before you use your new boots, ask your skate shop to waterproof
the soles.  You can do this yourself, and should after the original
coat becomes worn away.  Choose a time when your skates have had a
couple of days to dry out.  Gently unscrew the blades (note the long
screws in the heels!) and apply a coat of Heel and Sole enamel
(available at skate and shoe stores).  After it dries completely,
replace the blade.  Start all the screws gently in place before
tightening any all the way to make sure they're aligned properly.
Remember you're screwing into leather, and it's easy to deform the
holes.  Recheck the tightening after your next skate.  Keep your
blades screwed on firmly at all times, not only for the obvious safety
reason, but also to prevent undue wear on the screw holes and to keep
moisture from getting between blade and sole.  (First aid for
untightenable screws is to sprinkle some leather - never wood -
shavings into the screw holes.)</P>

<P>After skating, don't stuff your sweaty socks into your skates and
seal them all up in your waterproof skate bag to rot until the next
weekend.  Unpack your skates as soon as possible and leave them to dry
out (but not by a heat source!).  Treat your boot uppers occasionally
with a leather preservative such as Luxol.</P>

<H2> Lacing Your Skates </H2>

<P><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="sally-skate.gif" WIDTH=300>
Loosen your laces and stuff your feet in just like Cinderella.  For
roughly the first half of the holes, take up slack in the laces but
don't pull them tight; tightness in this area can cause foot cramps.
Do pull the laces up snugly for the last half of the holes across the
instep.  Hold this tightness in place with half a square knot (see
figure at right).  To lace around the hooks, wrap your laces over,
then under, each hook.  As you lace up the ankle, leave some extra
room.  Consider that when you skate with well-bent knees (and a
corresponding flex in the ankle), you should feel your shin leaning
firmly into the laces across the tongue.  If you don't have a good
secure feeling, you've got the laces too loose.  If they're too tight,
you'll have trouble bending your knees.  At no point should you be
trying to close the gap across the tongue by lacing tightly, nor
should you need a hook to pull up the laces.  If you seem to need
either of these, your boots are probably too big.</P>

<P>Finish off with a secure bow, but leave the loops long so you can
know them once together, the way your mom used to do with your first
sneakers.  This is especially useful for the slippery nylon laces some
people prefer for their "give".  Tuck what's left of the loops into
your skates so that there's no chance of catching your blade on
them.</P>
