You must be a USFS member, however, if you want to participate in competitions, tests, and synchronized skating. Becoming an USFS member will also subscribe you to the SKATING magazine. You may pay online on <a href="http://mit.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=729&cid=35&p=1">MIT's ticket website</a> or bring cash or check to one of our weekend meetings:
	<ul>

	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>*  Anyone who comes out on the ice must complete a club sports waiver, regardless of club membership. 
<p>** Dues include lessons for both students and non-students. Please attend only one lesson level per class offered. (In other words, do not attend both the intermediate and advanced lessons for freestyle skating.)</p>

<h2>Note About Cross-Registered Students</h2>
<p>Students from other universities may join a Club Sport, including the MIT Figure Skating Club, only during the terms while they are cross-registered at MIT.<p>

<h2>Note About Children</h2>
<p>The MIT Figure Skating Club is an MIT Club Sport. The <a href="http://clubsports.mit.edu/">Club Sports Council</a> (CSC) dictates the membership rules for all MIT Club Sports. Unfortunately, the CSC has decided that children of the MIT community are not eligible to participate in club sports. Therefore, we are no longer able to accept the children of MIT students, alumni, faculty and staff as members of our club.</p>

<p>Children covered by a current MIT family athletic card are welcome to skate during <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/skate.htm">general skating hours</a>.</p></div>
