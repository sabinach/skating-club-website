<h1>Testing Info</h1>
<p>Testing sessions are ways for you to track your progress and become eligible to compete in official competitions. USFS has multiple test levels in the different disciplines of figure skating: Basic Skills, Moves in the Field, Freestyle, Pairs, Ice Dance, Synchronized Skating. Each test requires the skater(s) to perform a set of required moves to be judged by a panel of USFS judges. These tests can be used to measure your progress and determine your appropiate competition level. For more information about beginning tests, check out the <a href="docs/test-guide2015.pdf">Testing Guide</a> compiled by Diana Cheng.</p>
<p>Only members of the MIT Figure Skating Club can test at our test sessions. For more information, please contact skating-officers[at]mit.edu.</p>
